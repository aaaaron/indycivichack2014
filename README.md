Some quick hacking for #indycivichack

Dataset came from https://communities.socrata.com/Public-Safety/Indiana-State-Police-Tickets-20140101-Thru-2014051/geug-a2k2

Makes a heatmap of all the traffic stops in the bounded range.  Started work on making the boundary changeable, didn't complete.

Seriously this is rapid hack code, don't judge me for this.
